Check this tutorial ---> Video

If you know of an open science hardware project (or maybe it's your own project!) that isn't listed in our map, do the following:

1. Go to [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org) and create a user (not mandatory but I recommend it so you can trace your changes)
2. Look for the project in the search box. 

**--> If project already has a page in Wikidata**

3. Make sure the six statements explained in *'Data model'* are there with their corresponding values

**--> If you can't find your project in Wikidata**

3. Create an item
4. Add a label and description of your project
5. Make sure you add the six statements explained in *'Data model'*, with their corresponding values

Finally, check if your node has been added in [the map](http://tinyurl.com/y2ehx763). It's not automatic, may take a while to update (max 20').
