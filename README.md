# Global Open Science Hardware Map

[Versión en español](leer.md)

[**The Map**](http://tinyurl.com/y5d6hqb3) 

This initiative aims to build a collaborative database of open science hardware projects around the world. It started with projects from Latin America as part of my [PhD](https://thessaly.github.io/phd/) and now we want to make it global as part of the [Global Open Source Hardware](https://openhardware.science) community. 

We're discussing the specifics of the map in [this thread](https://forum.openhardware.science/t/map-cadastre-list-of-open-science-hardware-initiatives-in-chile-latam/835/3), in case you want to check the latest news. It's still 'work in progress'.

>**Important note**    
> I'm changing the methodology from the original GitHub-csv powered to a new one using Wikidata, as I think it's easier both for collaboration and map visualization. For specifics of the data model behind the map and how to contribute, see ['I want to add a project'](CONTRIBUTING.md).
